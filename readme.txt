Instruction to run the code :-

(1) Open "Data_Preparation.ipynb" in jupyter notebook. It contains instructions for downloading and preparing the data at the begining.
This notebook should run smoothly if cells are run sequencially.

The python file name "utilities.py" contains helper functions so keep that file in the same directory.

(2) Open "FCN_from_scratch.ipynb" in jupyter notebook to run the FCN build from scratch. This notebook gives very detailed performance analysis both for binary and five class classification. This notebook should run smoothly if cells are run sequencially.

(3) open "FCN_vs_CNN.ipynb" in jupyter notebook to run CNN model build in pytorch. This notebook give conclusion of performance analysis between CNN and FCN in terms of trainable parameters required and accuracy achieved.
This notebook should also run smoothly cell by cell.
