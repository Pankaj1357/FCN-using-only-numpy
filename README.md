# Neural Network from scratch(only numpy)
A Fully connected neural network was build from scratch using numpy only. It had flexibility to built all type of FCN architechtures and taking an arbitary number of input features and arbitary number of output classes. We could use three types of activation function "sigmoid", "relu" for hidden layers and "sigmoid" / "softmax" for output layer. Cross Entropy Loss was used for binary as well as multiclass classification.

The built FCN was tested on Subset of CIFAR-10 dataset and it's performance was comapred with CNN models implemented using Pytorch.
